# Churn Analysis
I did churn analysis for brand that have a huge customers.

I got few results.

Briefly;
- all customer want to be a unique.
- customers call services is so important to gain or loss customers.
- people living in location code wants some discount to buy something.
- users logging in from computer tend not to churn.
- If number of time of customer length is more than 100 and there is no problem with customer services, they generally are still our customers.
